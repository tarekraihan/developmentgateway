The project will strengthen climate resilience and disaster preparedness in eight vulnerable coastal pourashavas (secondary towns) of Bangladesh. The project takes a holistic and integrated approach to urban development and will (i) provide climate-resilient municipal infrastructure; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity, local governance, and public awareness for improved urban planning and service delivery considering climate change and disaster risks. Key infrastructure investments include (i) drainage; (ii) water supply; (iii) sanitation; (iv) cyclone shelters; and (v) other municipal infrastructure including emergency access roads and bridges, solid waste management, bus terminals, slum improvements, boat landings, and markets. Investments will benefit the poor and women.
