								The Development Gateway team is a unique mix of techies — software engineers who research and build innovative new tools — and non-techies who understand development challenges. Most of our team members speak more than one language and have worked in various parts of the world. Project teams include members with a mix of skills, so that we approach problems with institutional as well as technical aspects in mind.
